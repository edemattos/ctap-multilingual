										It is a web tool for the automatic extraction and analysis of
										linguistic text characteristics which are commonly associated
										with linguistic complexity.

										CTAP allows for the flexible
										analysis of texts across languages.
										Currently, we support
										English an German and are working on the
										integration of Dutch,
										French, and Italian.

									<div class="panel-body">The corpus manager allows you to upload and
										maintain your corpora and data sets. You can create, edit, and
										delete corpora and you can optionally group them into folders,
										for example to link data sets derived from the same corpus.

										After creating a new corpus, you can load, edit, and delete
										text files by opening the corpus and inserting new texts by a)
										typing them manually and saving them or b) using the import
										function to upload one or more files from you computer. You
										can assign one or more tags to each text to further structure
										your data collection. These tags have to be predefined in the
										tag side panel. After creation, all tags will be available
										across corpora.</div>

								<div id="collapseThree" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree"

									<div class="panel-body">The feature selector allows you to generate and
										manage customised selections of text features. After
										generating a new feature set, you can select features from the
										list of available features and add them to your set of
										selected features. Different features are available for
										different languages as indicated by the languages tag. It is
										recommended to ensure that your final feature set contains
										only features that all share at least one language. You can
										select features based on their availability for specific
										languages using the select menu. You can also search for
										features by entering components of their feature name. To get
										more information on a specific feature, you can use the
										information button in the "Details" column. After choosing all
										features for your feature set, the feature selector will infer
										for which languages your feature set can be computed by CTAP,
										i.e. which langauges are shared between all features in the
										feature set..</div>

										After an analysis has been completed, you can download the
